h2. Introduction

p. Opinoid is a simple web application which syndicates news from a set of known RSS/Atom sources and provides visitors with a sorted list of articles (like Reddit), based on user's votes and comments. It uses "TornadoWeb":http://www.tornadoweb.org/, "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/, "jQuery":http://jquery.com/ and "Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/.

p. Requires python >= 2.6; if using python >= 2.7 you don't need to install the argparse module in your virtualenv.
