Opinoid is a simple web application which syndicates news from a set of known RSS/Atom sources and provides visitors with a sorted list of articles (like Reddit), based on user's votes and comments. It uses Tornado:http://www.tornadoweb.org , MongoDB:http://www.mongodb.org and jQuery:http://jquery.com
